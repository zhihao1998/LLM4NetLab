Detect link performance degradation:

- link_bandwidth_throttling
- link_high_latency
- link_high_latency_jitter
- link_high_packet_loss
- link_high_packet_corruption
- link_queue_overflow

Steps:
1. Run bidirectional iperf3 for 30s with bandwidth 2× link capacity.
2. On both ends run "tc -s qdisc show" and check dropped/overlimits.
3. Run ping -c 1000 -i 0.2 and compute RTT, jitter, loss, duplicates, checksum errors.
4. Check for tc police or shaping rules indicating throttling.
Report each fault.
