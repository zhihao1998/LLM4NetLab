Detect host IP misconfiguration:

- host_ip_conflict
- host_incorrect_ip
- host_missing_ip
- host_incorrect_netmask
- host_incorrect_gateway
- host_static_blackhole

Steps:
1. On every host run "ip -br a" and "ip route".
2. Aggregate all IP/netmask/gateway configurations.
3. Detect duplicate IPs, IPs outside subnet, missing IP, wrong netmask, wrong default gateway.
4. Look for static routes to 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to Null0 or discard.
Report each fault.
