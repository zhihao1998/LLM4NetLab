Evaluation criteria (each scored 1-5):

2. Correctness of tools/commands used  
3. Efficiency and sequence of actions  
4. Clarity of justification / explanatory reasoning in the agent’s actions  
5. Final outcome: whether the final submission exists and matches the problem ground truth  

Instructions:  
– For the provided agent's actions, briefly comment on its relevance, correctness, and efficiency.  
– Then give an overall evaluation: what worked well, what could be improved.  
– Score each of the 5 criteria individually (1 = poor, 5 = excellent).
