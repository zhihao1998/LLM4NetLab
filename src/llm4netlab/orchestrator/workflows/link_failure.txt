Detect complete physical/device failures:

- host_crash
- link_detach
- link_down
- link_flap
- bmv2_switch_down
- frr_service_down
- sdn_controller_crash

Steps:
1. Run "kathara llist" and "docker ps" to verify all devices are Up.
2. For every interface check "ip link" carrier and operstate.
3. Detect interfaces flapping >5 times in 5 minutes.
4. Verify BMv2, FRR, and controller processes are running.
5. A host with no process response but container Up → host_crash.
Report each fault separately.
