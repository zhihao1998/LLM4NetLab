Detect southbound interface problems:

- southbound_port_block
- southbound_port_mismatch

Steps:
1. Verify controller (Ryu/ONOS/ODL) and switches use the same OpenFlow port (6633/6653).
2. Check firewall rules and tcpdump for blocked or RST packets.
3. Inspect controller logs for connection/TLS failures.
Report each.
