Detect ARP cache poisoning and MAC address conflict.

Steps:
1. On every host run "arp -an" or "ip neigh" and collect all ARP tables.
2. Check for any IP mapped to multiple MACs (poisoning).
3. Check for any MAC used by multiple IPs on different hosts (MAC conflict).
4. On switches run "show mac address-table" and compare with ARP tables.
5. Look for kernel logs containing "duplicate address detected".
Report arp_cache_poisoning and mac_address_conflict separately.
