Detect BGP faults:

- bgp_asn_misconfig
- bgp_missing_route_advertisement
- bgp_blackhole_route_leak
- bgp_hijacking

Steps:
1. On every router run "show ip bgp summary" and "show ip bgp".
2. Verify neighbor ASNs match topology.
3. Check expected prefixes are advertised.
4. Detect unwanted private/blackhole prefixes being advertised.
5. Look for unexpected ASNs in AS_PATH (hijacking).
Report each.
