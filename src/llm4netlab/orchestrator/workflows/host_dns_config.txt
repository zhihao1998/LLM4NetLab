Detect wrong DNS configuration on hosts:

- host_incorrect_dns
- dhcp_wrong_dns

Steps:
1. On every host read /etc/resolv.conf.
2. Test resolution with dig @configured_dns chaos txt version.bind.
3. Compare configured DNS servers with topology expectations.
4. If obtained via DHCP, inspect DHCP server options (option 6).
Report both faults.
