Detect the following ACL blocking faults independently:

- arp_acl_block
- bgp_acl_block
- http_acl_block
- icmp_acl_block
- ospf_acl_block

Procedure:
1. From suitable hosts, generate real traffic for each protocol (ARP request, BGP OPEN, HTTP GET to a server, ICMP echo, OSPF Hello).
2. Capture packets on both sender and receiver simultaneously (tcpdump -i any -c 200).
3. On BMv2 switches or Linux routers, check for ACL/table rules that DROP packets matching the specific protocol/port.
4. If traffic is dropped and a matching DROP ACL exists → confirm that specific fault.
Report each fault as Detected / Not Detected with evidence.
